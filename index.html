    <h1> Welcome to Almost Farkle.</h1>
    <p> Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
<ul>
    <li> If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
    <li> The player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
    <li> If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
</ul>
    <p> For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-6, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 23 points to her score.</p>

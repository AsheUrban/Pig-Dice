    <h1>Welcome to Almost Farkle.</h1>
    <h3>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
    
    <ul>
        <il> If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</il>
        <il> The player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</il>
        <il> If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</il>
    </ul>
        <p>For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-6, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 23 points to her score.</p>
